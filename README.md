This is a project that intends to help people manage and monitor their grocery activities.
This project wants to demonstrate the use of java EE platform to provide web services to different clients; 
AngularJS as a SPA (Single Page Application) client to consume the offered services.

This is a personal project of the author to review and document his never-ending learning on new technologies. 
Furthermore, this concept project will hopefully actually be able to change how people manage and monitor how they shop for their own households.
